Description: This package will take a year and a specific stat (goals, assists, points, etc.) as user input, then
    use that input to scrape the league leaders for that statistic from the corresponding year. Data will be 
    scraped from https://www.hockey-reference.com/. Default will be set to the top 30 players for any given
    statistic, but user can optionally specify the number to print. The 'rvest' package will be used for 
    scraping, while the 'dplyr' package will be used for the sorting.
